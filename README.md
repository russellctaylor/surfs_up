A Sustainable Business year-round?
1.	Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gauge the sustainability of the business year round by comparing the monthly temperature data of June and December in Oahu. 

2.	Results
Three key differences.  In the month of December temperatures are on average three degrees cooler than in the month of June.  The coolest day in December can potentially be substantially cooler than the coolest day in June. There is a greater deviation of temperature in the month of December.
Summary
3.	Based on the data I believe the business is sustainable year around.  On the colder days in December might want to include an additional product line like coffee or hot drinks. Additional queries I would recommend is comparing the amount of precipitation between the months.
